      <p>
        Refurb-it seeks to refurbish secondhand furniture with creative and
        hand-picked artists to make old become new and unique. We strive to
        produce high quality products with the fraction of the price of major
        retailers while giving the customer a one-of-a-kind product.
      </p>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The project assigned was to create an Ecommerce responsive website that
        was hitting a target item that was hard to find in regular stores.
        Students were allowed all creative control and brand guidelines.
      </p>
      <h2>User Stories</h2>
      <p>
        We received over twelve user stories to select three from. Below are the
        three stories chosen for this project.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          As a new customer, I want to access the inventory without having to
          register, so that I can make sure this store has what Iâ€™m looking for
          before having to create an account.
        </li>
        <li>
          As a returning customer, I want to be able to save item that I cannot
          buy to a wish list, so that I can purchase them at a later date.
        </li>
        <li>
          As a returning customer, I want to see an overview of my previous
          activity, so that I can view previous purchases and search history.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Style Guide</h2>
      <p>
        My goal for the style of this project was to keep it modern and sleek
        and focus more on the images of the products. Photos that are used are
        staged as the item is likely used, with bright lightening.

      <h2>User Testing</h2>
      <p>
        Once the low fidelity wireframes were completed, I then selected three
        users to participate in the user testing. The users were given four
        scenarios to walk through in the prototypes of the website.

      <h2>Final High-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
      <p>
        After user testing was completed and changes were made based off the
        opinions of the testers, I selected the final UI iterations.
